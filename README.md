# Crime-Analysis-in-Toronto

## Project Overview 
In the bustling city of Toronto, understanding and mitigating crime trends is of paramount importance for maintaining public safety and well-being. Our project endeavors to delve deep into the rich tapestry of crime data within Toronto, employing advanced data analytics to discern patterns, identify hotspots, and uncover the underlying factors influencing crime rates. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to predict crime classes, providing law enforcement agencies and policymakers with actionable insights to allocate resources effectively and develop targeted interventions. Through meticulous analysis and interpretation of extensive crime data, our endeavor seeks to contribute to a safer and more secure environment for all residents and visitors of Toronto.

## Business Problem 
Our project aims to delve deep into the crime trends within the city of Toronto. By analyzing extensive crime data, we focus on identifying patterns, hotspots, and factors influencing crime rates.

## Data Collection and Methodology
### Data Collection
The dataset is provided by the Toronto Police Service and can be accessed through the Toronto Public Safety Portal. The portal aims to promote transparency and public awareness regarding crime in the city.

### Key Stakeholders
- Law Enforcement Agencies: Utilize findings to strategize and implement effective policing.
- Policymakers: Make informed decisions to enhance public safety regulations and resource allocation.
- Community Organizations: Use insights for community awareness and preventive measures.
- Residents of Toronto: Direct beneficiaries of improved safety and security measures in the city.

### Data Fields
The dataset includes various variables that provide information about each crime incident such as date and related offences, categories include Assault, Break and Enter, Auto Theft, Robbery and Theft Over, Premises type, location, neighborhood, latitude, and longitude, etc.

### Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing using Python Libraries:**
Python libraries played a crucial role in refining our raw datasets for analysis. These preprocessing steps were pivotal in preparing a clean and standardized dataset, laying the foundation for our subsequent machine learning model.

- **Data Visualization with Tableau:**
Using Tableau, we crafted interactive visualizations showcasing crime trends over time and space. Demographic insights and the exploration of environmental factors were seamlessly portrayed, providing a comprehensive understanding of the contextual elements influencing criminal activity.

### Exploaratory Data Analysis
- **Key Insights**
  - **Temporal Trends:**
Crime events increased from 2014 to 2023, with fluctuations suggesting influencing factors.
  - **Major Crime Categories:**
Assault is most frequent, followed by Break and Enter, Auto Theft, Robbery, and Theft Over.
  - **Police Division Analysis:**
Certain divisions show significantly higher crime rates, requiring targeted interventions.
  - **Hourly Distribution:**
Peak and off-peak hours of criminal activity identified for resource deployment.
  - **Neighborhood Crime Rates:**
Assault dominant across neighborhoods, with localized variations in other crime types.
  - **Premises Type and Day of Week Trend Analysis:**
Outdoor areas, apartments, and commercial establishments have higher crime rates with peaks on Fridays and weekends.

## Machine Learning Algorithms:
This project incorporates a diverse array of machine learning algorithms, including the Random Forest Classifier as the foundational model. We have further bolstered our approach by leveraging Lazy Predict Classifier models, as well as integrating advanced techniques such as Fully Connected Neural Networks and Time Series Analysis into our methodology.
